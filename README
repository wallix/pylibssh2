pylibssh2 1.1.0
================

1.0.0 release, may 2010
1.1.0 release, july 2011

What
----

pylibssh2 is a python binding for libssh2 library, it was forked and rewrote
from scratch using old org.keyphrene (http://sourceforge.net/projects/orgkeyphrene/)
bindings.

I wrote this extension at Wallix (http://wallix.com) to provide an easy
way to manage SSH2 connection through libssh2 library in python.

This is a C extension module to provide a high level python API. libssh2 API is
fairy well respected and export into a python API.

Packaging and API is documented with epydoc format.

      (older version after 0.18 can works too)
